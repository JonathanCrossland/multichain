# Getting Started

The first thing to do is to create a node, so you can get the Explorer and Test Suite connected. 
We defer you to Multichain in order to do this: follow their guide.

[https://www.multichain.com/developers/creating-connecting/](https://www.multichain.com/developers/creating-connecting/)

```
multichain-util create [chain-name]
// highly recommended that you bolt on -datadir=path 
// eg. c:\multichain\chains otherwise its created in appRoaming or other default location

//Before you run the next step, read AllowRPC and Multichain Configuration below

multichaind [chain-name] -daemon
```

## Multichain Configuration (params.dat)

When you first create the chain a folder is created and a file called params.dat is written to define your blockchain's config.

Opening this file will show a list of key value options. Open it in an editor and Look for "port" where you will find:

```
# The following parameters were generated by multichain-util.
# They SHOULD ONLY BE EDITED IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. 

default-network-port = 9265             # Default TCP/IP port for peer-to-peer connection with other nodes.
default-rpc-port = 9264                 # Default TCP/IP port for incoming JSON-RPC API requests.
chain-name = lucidocean_test            # Chain name, used as first argument for multichaind and multichain-cli.
```
This is the chain name, the node's communication port and the JSON-RPC port. You will need this when you set up the Explorer and this library.

## AllowRPC (multichain.conf)

As you have seen in the previous section, a node runs with two ports, the peer connection between nodes is served on a different port to the RPC. Nodes typically connect on port 5000 and the RPC API runs on 5001. This can be changed.

In order to talk to this node via JSON-RPC (enabling the LucidOcean.MultiChain library), you need to enable the port and setup connection settings. Ensure a firewall is not blocking it.

Open a file called multichain.conf

You will find a username and password required for the library to connect as well as an AllowRPC with your IP.

```
rpcuser=THIS_IS_YOUR_USER
rpcpassword=THIS_IS_YOUR_PASSWORD
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
```

## Connection Settings

In the source there are two connections to set, if you are using the nuget package, only one.

Running the Explorer:
- Open ExplorerSettings.cs in LucidOcean.MultiChain.Explorer.Data
- Modify the Connection params to match your chain

Running a Test
- Open TestSettings.cs
- Modify the Connection params to match your chain

Using the C# Library

You need to create a MultichainClient and initialise it, then make a call.

```
Connection con = new MultiChainConnection()
{
    Hostname = "your_ip",
    Port = your_port,
    Username = "your_username",
    Password = "your_password",
    ChainName = "your_chain_name",
    BurnAddress = "your_burn_address",
    RootNodeAddress = "_your_root_node"
};

MultichainClient client = new MultichainClient(con);
JsonRpcResponse<Dictionary<string , object>> response = client.Utility.GetBlockChainParams();
```
